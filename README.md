## Testing

To test the application:

- You can either create new accounts or log in using existing ones:
  - Username: `Bob123` Password: `123`
  - Username: `John123` Password: `123`
- Note: Local storage is used for user authentication status. For live messaging between users on the same device, use different browsers (e.g., Bob123 on Safari and John123 on Chrome).
